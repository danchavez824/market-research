What is the projected market size & growth rate of the Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramic Market?

Market Analysis and Size

Co-firing can be classified into low temperature and high temperature. Low temperature co-fired ceramic is a multi-layer glass-ceramic substrate that is co fired with low firing metal conductors. A low temperature co-fired ceramic device provides the solution to the integration of passive components such as resistors, capacitors, and resonators, filters among others. The low temperature co-fired ceramic technology is useful in terms of a wide range of applications, including high-volume automotive systems. Thus, due to the growth and expansion of the automobile sector, the demand for low temperature co-fired ceramic technology will conclusively rise.

Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the global low temperature co-fired ceramic market which was USD 4.02 billion in 2022, is expected to reach USD 9.54 billion by 2030, and is expected to undergo a CAGR of 10.00% during the forecast period. “Automobile” dominates the end-users segment of the global low temperature co-fired ceramic market due to the widespread use of sensors in many automotive subsystems, such as engines, transmissions, and brake systems. When utilized for a long time, the performance of these sensors deteriorates due to their frequent exposure to high temperatures and harsh operating conditions. That is why it is crucial for this industry to embrace global low temperature co-fired ceramics. In addition to the insights on market scenarios such as market value, growth rate, segmentation, geographical coverage, and major players, the market reports curated by the Data Bridge Market Research also include in-depth expert analysis, geographically represented company-wise production and capacity, network layouts of distributors and partners, detailed and updated price trend analysis and deficit analysis of supply chain and demand.
