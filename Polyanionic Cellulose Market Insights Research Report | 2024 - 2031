Market Analysis and Insights :

Global Polyanionic Cellulose Market

The polyanionic cellulose market is expected to witness market growth at a rate of 7.2% in the forecast period of 2022 to 2029 and is expected to reach USD 48.1 million by 2029. Data Bridge Market Research report on polyanionic cellulose market provides analysis and insights regarding the various factors expected to be prevalent throughout the forecast period while providing their impacts on the market’s growth. The rise in the demand for polyanionic cellulose from the fast growing food and beverage industry is escalating the growth of polyanionic cellulose market.

Polyanionic cellulose (PAC) is known to be a form of water-soluble cellulose ether derivative manufactured by the chemical modification of natural cellulose. It is an essential type of water-soluble cellulose ether. Polyanionic cellulose finds significant applications in offshore exploration and production, drilling and salt well operations in the upstream oil and gas industry.

Major factors that are expected to boost the growth of the polyanionic cellulose market in the forecast period are the rise in the rate of penetration and good bore stability, especially for rotary drillings systems. Furthermore, the growing demand for drilling fluids with high salt and acid resistance is further anticipated to propel the growth of the polyanionic cellulose market. Moreover, the increase in the need for additives that upsurge the viscosity of fluids at high temperature (150°C) found in seawater, freshwater, and saturated brine well is further estimated to cushion the growth of the polyanionic cellulose market. On the other hand, the growing production cost is further projected to impede the growth of the polyanionic cellulose market in the timeline period.

In addition, the increasing need for polyanionic cellulose as a rheology controller, filtrate reducer, and colloid protector in several other end-user industries such as pharmaceutical and chemical will further provide potential opportunities for the growth of the polyanionic cellulose market in the coming years. However, the variation in the raw material prices might further challenge the growth of the polyanionic cellulose market in the near future.
