Market Analysis and Insights:

Global Polarized Sunglasses Market

Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the polarized sunglasses market will witness a CAGR of 7.86% for the forecast period. Rising population around the globe, rising awareness regarding the protection of eyes, advancement in the technology coupled with new and eyewear innovative product offerings are some of the major factors driving the growth of polarized sunglasses market.

The function of polarized sunglasses is similar to regular sunglasses which is to protect the eyes against harmful UV radiations. However, polarized sunglasses are an upgraded or modified version of regular sunglasses. The filter in polarized sunglasses create vertical opening for the light. This means that the lenses will block the horizontal sun rays and only the light rays that vertically approach the eyes will be allowed to enter through the openings. The filter used in polarized sunglasses helps in reduction of glare reflection. Glare distorts the original colour of the objects and makes it difficult to identify and distinguish them. As a result, polarized sunglasses are recommended in activities in which there is high exposure to sun rays such as driving, fishing and so on.

Polarized sunglasses are available in wide range, shapes and sizes. Therefore, a customer is attracted towards them and is left with a wide variety to be chosen from. Rising demand for eyewear that helps to tackle glare reflection is in turn inducing the growth in demand for polarized sunglasses globally. Rising awareness regarding the harmful effects of UV rays and directly exposing off eyes to the sun rays is propelling the growth of polarized sunglasses market. Also, rising awareness regarding the benefits to maintain the health of eyes is creating lucrative growth opportunities for the polarized sunglasses market.

However, high costs associated with polarized sunglasses as compared to regular sunglasses will challenge the market growth rate. Polarized sunglasses make it difficult to see LCD screens. This will also adversely affect their market demand.
