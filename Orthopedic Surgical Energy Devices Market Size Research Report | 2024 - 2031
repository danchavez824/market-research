Global Orthopedic Surgical Energy Devices Market

Global orthopedic surgical energy devices market is expected to gain market growth in the forecast period of 2022 to 2029. Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the market is growing with a CAGR of 7.8% in the forecast period of 2022 to 2029 and is expected to reach USD 1,640.21 million by 2029 from USD 877.52 million in 2021. The rising prevalence of osteoporosis, rise in incidence of sports and trauma injuries will propel the market's demand in the forecast period.

Orthopedic surgical devices are devices, which are implemented to correct the bone deformities and to restore the function of the human skeletal system. The orthopedic surgical energy devices use energy such as radiation, radio frequency and ultrasound, to seal the skin and bone tissue. The orthopedic surgical energy devices require an energy source, such as an electrosurgery generator (ESU), and an instrument to transfer the energy to the patient. The important types include radio frequency (RF), basically modified electrical current, and ultrasound, which converts electrical current into mechanical motion. More specialized technologies include those that use argon gas, plasma, or a combination of technologies.

The types of orthopedic surgical energy devices are handpieces and accessories. The orthopedic handpieces are used by doctors of the orthopedics department to create holes in bones. Common reasons for drilling bones in surgery are fixing implants and fitting prosthetic devices. The bone drill is sometimes referred to as a saw, and certain types can also be used manually, although this is less common at the present time. The orthopedic accessories assist in support and protection against injuries and sources of pain in the body.

In this mode of treatment, the orthopedic surgical energy devices are engineered to provide less pain after surgery for other factors, which give the orthopedic surgical energy devices, an edge over other existing surgical energy devices. The technological developments, aim to reduce the invasive pain caused during the bone surgery. The orthopedic surgical energy devices are applied for vital surgeries such as hip replacement, total hip arthroplasty, knee replacement, and total knee replacement.

The driving factors responsible for the growth of the global orthopedic surgical energy devices market are the increase in incidence of osteoporosis, rise in geriatric population, technological advancements in the orthopedic surgical devices, and rise in product launches. However, the factors which are expected to restrain the market are the high cost associated with the orthopedic surgical energy devices, rise in technical issues in orthopedic surgical energy devices, and lack of skilled professional. Moreover, the strategic initiatives by market players and the rise in healthcare expenditure bolsters the orthopedic surgical energy devices growth.
