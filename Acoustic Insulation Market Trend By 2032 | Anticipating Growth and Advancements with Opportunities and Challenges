Market Analysis and Insights

Acoustic Insulation Market

Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the acoustic insulation market will witness a CAGR of 4.81% for the forecast period of 2021-2028. Increasing demand for aerogel as a substitute for glass wool especially in the developing economies like India and China, growing use of acoustic insulation by a wide range of end user verticals such as building and construction, transportation, manufacturing and processing and others and surge in industrialization especially in the developing countries are the major factors attributable to the growth of the acoustic insulation market.

Acoustic insulation is a technique of covering the machinery with a layer of insulation. This is done to reduce noise emissions produced by the machinery. The acoustic insulation materials help to minimize airborne sound transfer by installing them within floors, walls and ceilings. Owing to their durable properties, acoustic insulation materials are used by a wide range of industry verticals.

Rise in demand for acoustic insulation owing to the rising prevalence of noise pollution coupled with growing incidences of health issues is the root cause fuelling up the market growth rate. Rising industrialization coupled with growth and expansion of various end user verticals especially in the developing economies will also directly and positively impact the growth rate of the market. Growth in the building and construction activities, rising popularity of sound absorption materials in the entertainment industry and strident regulations imposed by the government on industries in regards to noise pollution will further carve the way for the growth of the market.

However, high costs associated with the materials will pose a major challenge to the growth of the market. Fluctuations in the prices of raw materials will dampen the market growth rate. Also, lack of awareness in the backward economies will further derail the market growth rate. Slowdown in the European construction industry and unfavourable conditions arising due to the COVID-19 outbreak will impede the market growth rate.
