Market Analysis and Insights:

Global Vegetable Protein Market

Vegetable protein market is expected to be growing at a growth rate of 10.2% in the forecast period of 2021 to 2028. The increase in innovations in the technologies used for extraction of vegetable-based protein will act as a driving factor to the growth of the vegetable protein market.

Proteins are chains of polymers that are made up from amino acids connected with peptide bonds. During the digestion process, proteins break down in the stomach to constitute even smaller polypeptide chains along with protease and hydrochloric acid actions. This development is crucial for the consumption of vital amino acids, which cannot be biosynthesized by the human body. A great number of the plant foods, with the exclusion of spinach, soy, and quinoa are usually low in a few important amino acids, but they can be attained through the involvement of a collection of whole vegetable-based foods in the diet.

Increase in demand for vegetable-based proteins is estimated to grow at a swift pace because of the increase in demand for food and beverage goods for example bakery products, meat replacements, cereals, snacks, and nutritional additives, leaning towards clean eating, rise in the health concerns, and the environmental concerns, as well as animal welfare, and more. This growth is more promoted, for example by the marketing efforts seized by the operators of plant proteins and a rise in social media and its impact upon the customers. In addition, the allergies associated with textured vegetable protein sources such as soy and wheat further demote the growth of the vegetable protein market. The COVID-19 pandemic further has had a serious impact on the vegetable-based protein market. The increase in customer awareness of the influence of the pandemic on meat production, customers have begun to adopt vegetable-based replacements instead. The pandemic has also impacted the sales of plant-based snacks, dairy replacements, and additives, as customers have moved towards a healthier lifestyle.

Opportunities for the members in the vegetable proteins market are in abundance, due to the increase in vegetarianism, around the world. Modern generation customers are more mindful than ever of the negative influence that a non-vegetarian diet leaves on the world and moving forward towards a more sustainable vegetarian/ vegan diet. However, processing complication of the extraction of textured vegetable protein is one of the key points challenges faced by the vegetable protein industry. Additionally, the allergies for example of soy and wheat among others coupled with fabricated vegetable protein sources for instance soy and wheat further hinders the growth of the vegetable protein market. Furthermore, to meet the increasing demand of several vegetable-based protein sources, farmers have often been growing genetically modified (GM) crops, which is most of the time seen as a disadvantage by consumers.
