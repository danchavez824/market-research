Market Growth Drivers:
Increasing Demand for Skin Care Products from Steel and Iron Industries
According to Lucideon, it has been projected that the iron and steel businesses are the largest consumers of refractory materials accounting for around two-thirds of refractory usage globally.
The process chain in the steel business from primary to secondary steel making procedures is a diversity of vessels that exist for the central units such as the electric arc furnace and blast furnace and the more maintenance-intensive components such as tap holes, launders, and submerged entry nozzles. Skin Care Products are the topmost materials used by steel production in the internal linings of furnaces for making iron and steel, in furnaces for heating steel before further processing, in vessels for holding and transporting metal and slag the flues or stacks through which hot gases are conducted. According to Fiber Cast, the iron and steel segment has been assessed to make up around 60.0% of all refractory industries.
Growing Demand for Metal and Non-Metal Castings in Manufacturing of Heavy Machinery
Heavy machinery types are vehicles designed for executing heavier functions, primarily construction tasks such as earthwork operations. They are classified into six major system types: implementation, power train, traction, structure, control, and information. Since these machinery pieces are immense, the manufacturing of these requires a humongous amount of metal and non-metal castings. The growing demand for castings for the manufacture of heavy machinery types is a significant driver for the global Skin Care Products market because the bulk production of the castings necessary to manufacture this heavy machinery depends on refractories.
