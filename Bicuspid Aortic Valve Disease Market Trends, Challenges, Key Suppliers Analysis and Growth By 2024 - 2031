Bicuspid aortic valve disease market is expected to gain market growth in the forecast period of 2022-2029. Data Bridge Market Research analyses the market to account to grow at a CAGR of 6% in the above mentioned forecast period.

Bicuspid aortic valve disease (BAV) referred to the most common congenital heart abnormality. The aortic valve is a one-way valve that connects the heart to the aorta, the primary artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The aortic valve normally contains three tiny flaps or leaflets that open widely and close tightly to regulate blood flow, allowing blood to pass from the heart to the aorta while preventing blood from returning to the heart. The valve has only two leaflets in bicuspid aortic valve disease (BAVD). The valve may not work correctly because of this abnormality, yet it may function well for years without creating symptoms or noticeable evidence of a problem.

The rise in the prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve disease is the major driver resulting in the expansion of market’s growth. Another significant factor influencing the growth rate of bicuspid aortic valve disease market is the rising healthcare expenditure. Furthermore, advancement in the medical technology, growing government funding and rising initiatives by public and private organisations to spread awareness are the factors that will expand the bicuspid aortic valve disease market. Other factors such as increase in smoking and upsurge in the number of cases of chronic kidney diseases will positively impact the market growth rate. Also, growing incidences of high blood pressure and rising number of patients with high cholesterol levels will result in the expansion of bicuspid aortic valve disease market.

Moreover, the rise in the new product development activities and emerging new market will provide beneficial opportunities for the bicuspid aortic valve disease market in the forecast period of 2022-2029.

However, high cost associated with the treatment will impede the growth rate of bicuspid aortic valve disease market. Additionally, complications involved with bicuspid aortic valve disease such as heart failure, narrowing of valve’s opening, infection of heart muscle, leakage of blood through the valve back into the heart and others will hinder the bicuspid aortic valve disease market growth. Less awareness about bicuspid aortic valve disease will further challenge the market in the forecast period mentioned above.
