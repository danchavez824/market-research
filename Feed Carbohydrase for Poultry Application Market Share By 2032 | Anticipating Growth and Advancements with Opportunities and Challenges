Market Analysis and Size

As feed ingredients contain some non-degradable harmful elements that restrict the digestive process and the animals lack the necessary enzymes required to degrade those complexes in the feed, poultry are unable to digest approximately 25% of the diet they are given. Enzymes are chemicals or catalysts that cells release to accelerate specific chemical reactions. They aid in the reduction of reaction time without being a part of the reaction. When digestibility-improving enzymes are used in animal feed, they help break down parts of the diet that the animal's digestive system cannot break down effectively on its own.
