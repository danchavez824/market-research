Market Analysis and Insights :

Global Air Powered Vehicle Market

The air powered vehicle market is expected to witness market growth at a rate of 106.15% in the forecast period of 2021 to 2028. Data Bridge Market Research report on air powered vehicle market provides analysis and insights regarding the various factors expected to be prevalent throughout the forecast period while providing their impacts on the market’s growth.

Air powered vehicle is also referred as air compressed vehicle. It is a green vehicle that utilizes a compressed air engine, a substitute of the internal combustion (IC) engine and works on the principle of the compressed air technology (CAT). An air powered vehicle uses compressed air, a non-polluting fuel, as a power source in turn to run the vehicle. The air powered vehicle provides long life of the vehicle, high energy density of the compressed air, and low toxicity in comparison to the other substitutes of the IC engine vehicle.

Factors such as the rising demand for the clean and sustainable energy, extended life-cycle, low toxicity and the strict guidelines related to the vehicular emissions are expected to boost the growth of the air powered vehicle market. Furthermore, the increase in the cost of fossil fuel, because of its limited stock and the accessibility, and the upsurge in the demand for emission-free vehicles are few of the factors anticipated to propel the growth of the air powered vehicle market in the forecast period. Moreover, the health influences prompted because of the harmful carbon emission from fossil fuel-powered vehicles, the inadequate resources of the fossil fuel and the rise in the air pollution are expected to boost the demand of air powered vehicle.

Also, the air powered vehicle is known to be economical, needs low refuelling price, and it is more effective than the conventional fossil fuel-powered vehicle which will further cushion the growth of the air powered vehicle market in the timeline period. However, the high cost of the air powered vehicles, the low speed of the air powered vehicle and the inadequate infrastructure for the refuelling are the factors most likely to further obstruct the growth of the air powered vehicle market.

Moreover, the increase in the acceptance of the electric vehicles, because of the emission issues, the government subsidies and the incentives being provided on the purchases on electric vehicles are also further expected to impede the growth of the air powered vehicle market in the coming years. Despite that, the increasing need for alternatives like electric vehicles might further challenge the growth of the air powered vehicle market in the near future.
